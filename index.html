                        We’ve heard stories of God moving in mighty ways during the Coronavirus pandemic. There’s no way to know if it’s because we are paying more attention to His movements or because we are making room for Him to move. Maybe it is both. No matter the reason, there's a lot to record in this season:

                        There will come a time when life returns to normal, first a “new normal” and then back to how life was before the pandemic. At first it will be easy to remember what life was like during this pandemic, but over time the memories may fade as the pandemic is written into history. We might forget how we saw God in the midst of this, what he taught us, and the eye-opening moments when we realized God was working in our lives to prepare us for such a time as this.
 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we forget, let’s record the signs of God’s mighty power, His lessons for us, and His revelations of His work that prepared us for a time like this. Looking back, we will be able to remember our stories and share them with future generations.
                    </p>

                        ...so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever.<br>
                        <em>Joshua 4:24</em>

                    <blockquote>
                        I will remember the deeds of the Lord;<br>
                            yes, I will remember your wonders of old.<br>
                        I will ponder all your work,<br>
                            and meditate on your mighty deeds.<br>
